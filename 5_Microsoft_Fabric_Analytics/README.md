# 🧱 Microsoft Fabric & Power BI — Analytics Engineering (Developing Competency)

This section documents my growing expertise in **Microsoft Fabric**, **Power BI**, and **enterprise analytics engineering**.  
It includes work on modern data engineering pipelines, semantic modeling, visualization, and real-time analytics using the Microsoft unified data stack.

> 📌 *This pillar is actively expanding as I complete Microsoft Fabric training and Power BI certification coursework.*

---

## 🎯 Objectives of This Pillar

- Build end-to-end **Fabric Lakehouse** architectures  
- Develop **Power BI data models**, DAX measures, star schemas  
- Design enterprise-ready **semantic models**  
- Automate ingestion using **Fabric Dataflows Gen2**  
- Create **Pipelines** for scalable ETL/ELT orchestration  
- Explore **Real-Time Analytics (KQL)** for streaming data  
- Produce interactive Power BI dashboards for analytics storytelling
